# scotland_schools

In this repo, I am analysing the schools in Scotland, focusing on the deprivation rate of the zone they are located.

The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of Scottish schools in order to derive valuable insights.
The analysis includes clustering and descriptive analysis, taking into account factors such as deprivation rate and total number of pupils.
Additionally, an interactive map of Scotland has been developed to visually represent the location of each school.
The clustering model has categorized local authorities into three distinct clusters based on average pupil count and deprivation score.
The map highlights areas predominantly occupied by schools facing high levels of deprivation.
The aim is to assist charities or non-governmental organizations (NGOs) involved in projects supporting these school pupils.
All data used in this analysis is publicly available and sourced from the Scottish Government website.
The Postcodes.io API was utilized to gather latitude and longitude coordinates for each school based on their respective postcodes.
The codes for clustering, visualizations, map generation, and API applications can be found in this repository.
